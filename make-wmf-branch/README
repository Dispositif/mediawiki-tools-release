# Configuration

  The list of extensions and skins that are branched is loaded from config.json,
  which is located in the same directory as the script.

  Other configuration values are loaded from default.conf, which should be a
  simple PHP include file that assigns values to local variables to override
  the defaults contained in MakeWmfBranch.php.
